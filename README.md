# GoldPrice-forecasting-CNN-LSTM-basedon-IndiaMacroEconomicData
Gold Price Prediction using CNN-LSTM and CNN-GRU model: We have built univariate and multivariate CNN-LSTM, CNN-GRU and many variants of LSTM, GRU, ARIMA, SARIMAX, SVR and feed-forward neural network to forecast next week gold price in INR. We used global indices like S&P 500, Nifty50, many macroeconomics data like GDP per capita, GNI per capita, Inflation rate, Interest rate, 10Yrs Bond yield published by Reserve Bank of India (RBI), precious metals like silver and copper prices, etc. as input to our models.
